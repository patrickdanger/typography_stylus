# Typography for Stylus

In-progress stylus mixins and font definitions support, written
in stylus.  These base imports are designed to be the starting
point for projects that use explicit content typography (which
all of our projects should).

The _type.styl include should be imported directly after a css
nullifier or reset stylesheet to put back base typographic styles
while the _fonts.styl include should contain ... well, fonts.
